My name is Heidi and I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at UZH. 


I set up this blog using [knitr](yihui.name/knitr/), [servr](https://github.com/yihui/servr), 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) and [RStudio](rstudio.com).
You can view the source code on [github](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/HeidiSeibold.github.io).

Installing all the parts needed to set up a blog like this can be tedious. That is why I use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and just start a container with the neccessary details installed.
See the [link](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/HeidiSeibold.github.io/tree/master/_build)
for the Dockerfile. 


For many more blogs on R and stats go to [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).
