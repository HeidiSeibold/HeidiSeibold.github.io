I have been thinking about writing a blog for a pretty long time. Half a year
at least.  And my question has been all that time if I really have something to
contribute.  I want to blog about statistics, about R, my life as a PhD student
at the [University of
Zurich](http://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/departments/biostatistics.html). But
will anyone bother to read it? There were a couple of things that finally got
me going: The enthusiasm I took home from my first
[useR!-conference](http://user2015.math.aau.dk/),
[Chris](https://ch.linkedin.com/pub/christoph-molnar/89/771/637) - my wonderful
boyfriend and a great statistician - and the confidence I got by giving my
first [R
course](http://www.vorlesungen.uzh.ch/HS15/lehrangebot/fak-50000008/sc-50544113/cga-50544113010/cg-50530663/sm-50750038/e-50743206.details.html)
and seeing that people seem to like my style of explaining things.

And in the end, if nobody cares about what I write, I will at least have
something for myself. I will at least not forget the things I have learned and
wrote down in a blog post.
