I have to be honest: I am addicted to listening to audio podcasts. Every working day I 
spend at least 30 minutes listening. I have started looking forward to long train rides
because I can catch up on my listening. In fact, you are lucky I am writing this post 
right now because I am on the train from Zurich to Heidelberg and it was a hard choice
between listening and writing this :)

Of course I want to share my podcast knowledge with you and please leave a
comment if there is another podcast you think I should listen to. I am always interested
in more.

There is *no ranking* here. I have phases in which I prefer listening to one over the other
but they are all good.


## Science related podcasts

#### [Open Science Radio](http://www.openscienceradio.de/)
I discoverd this podcast by Konrad Foerstner and Matthias Fromm early this 
summer and loved it from the start. Many of their episodes are in English and
some in German. They talk about anything that is going on in the world of 
Open Science. 

#### [Science: Disrupt](http://sciencedisrupt.com/)
This podcast is highly professional and I love the teasers they have in the 
beginning. They talk about new developments going on in science as a profession. 
Usually they interview
guests with a interesting projects.

#### [The Effort Report](http://effortreport.libsyn.com/)
This is a must listen for every young researcher who wants to stay in science.
Each episode deals with a different topic researchers struggle with and  the
hosts Roger Peng and Elisabeth Matsui talk about how they personally deal with the 
struggles.

#### [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/)
This podcasts is all about TED talks. Each episode has a special topic;
several TED talks are featured and the speakers iterviewed. The perfect audio
alternative to watching the presentations.

#### [PLOScast](http://blogs.plos.org/plospodcasts/)
I just discovered this podcast very recently after it was brought up in the 
Open Science Podcast. As the name suggests it is the podcast from the PLOS journal
and as such they talk a lot about open science as well.




## Stats related podcasts

#### [Not so standard deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) 
This podcast by Hilary Parker and (again) Roger Peng is the most relaxing data science
podcast. It's just like listening to an interesting conversation that you can't
contribute to (except by tweeting to [@SSDeviations](https://twitter.com/NSSDeviations)). They talk a lot about R and
common problems in the life of a data scientist. 

#### [Data stories](http://datastori.es/)
This is one of my newer discoveries. In data stories the hosts Enrico Bertini and Moritz Stefaner 
interview guests who do interesting analyses.

#### [Talking machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/)
Talking machines is a machine learning podcast. It often features interesting
machine learning methods. As such it is sometimes hard for me 
to understand. Every once in a while they have truly fascinating episodes that I 
like a lot and for machine learners who want to learn more stuff this is definetly
the go-to podcast.



## Other good podcasts

#### [Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia)
This is definetly the most touching podcast I have listened to. It has happened
that I sat on the train crying a little bit. It features the unvisible things
in life, which sounds a little superstitious but it really is not. Unfortunately, but
considering the research effort they have to go throug understandably, there are
quite few episodes each year.

#### [Philosophy Bites](http://www.philosophybites.com/)
Every episode of Philosophy Bites deals with one philosophical topic. The 
podcast guests are usually philosophers who deal with this topic every day.
The episodes are quite short, so this is a nice podcast for a 20 minute commute.

#### [Echo der Zeit](http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/echo-der-zeit)
This is the best daily Swiss news podcast.

#### [Das Computermagazin (B5 aktuell)](http://www.br.de/radio/b5-aktuell/sendungen/computermagazin/computermagazin108.html)
B5 aktuell is the news radio in Bavaria (Germany). They have this surprisingly
outstanding podcast about anything a geek in Germany would want to know. From 
new devices to new EU laws dealing with the internet it provides just great
information to bavarian listeners each sunday.

I listen to all my podcasts on my smartphone. After having tried a couple of 
different apps I ended up using BeyondPod with which I am very happy.
