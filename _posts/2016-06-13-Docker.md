## How it all started

This spring I went to the [rOpenSci Unconf](http://unconf16.ropensci.org/).
I went there being quite nervous, because so many great and super smart people would be there. 
The event was organized as a sort of hackathon where people would work on different projects
they were interested in. In the weeks before the unconf people were posting
[ideas](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf16/issues) on what they would like to work on. There
were so many topics I didn't even understand what they were about. The first project I decided
to join in on was called 
[Tutorials for more advanced topics with R](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf16/issues/35).
As I consider myself an advanced R user I felt like I could do that. The group decided to 
work on different topics, one of which was a Docker tutorial for R users. I did not know 
exactly what Docker is. Just that it was similar to a virtual machine, but somehow cooler.
I found it very intriguing and had been thinking I should learn about this Docker thing
anyway. So I went ahead and joined in on the team and learned. What we produced is still
work in progress, but I am pretty proud being part of it:

Sean made a list list of the other projects from the unconference on his [blog](http://seankross.com/notes/runconf16/).

## What I use Docker for
For a broader explanation on what Docker is why to use it please see the 
[first lesson](http://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/01-what-and-why.html) of 
the tutorial. I will just tell a little bit about I have been using Docker since I learned
it myself. 

#### Docker as a portable computer with fixed settings
I love writing this blog, but installing all the things to get it running was a pain.
But I will not have to worry about this again. I have a
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/HeidiSeibold.github.io/tree/master/_build),
which is just a plain text file that builds a Docker image. I just copy this onto any
computer (e.g. by checking out my git repository with my 
[blog stuff](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/HeidiSeibold.github.io)), build the Docker 
image, start the container and have RStudio running in my browser in no time. And I 
know the stuff installed in this container are allways the same. It just works.

#### Docker images as ensurance of reproducible research
In a previous [blog post](http://heidiseibold.github.io/r/2016/02/07/Reproducibility/) 
I wrote about my goal to make my research fully reproducible. With Docker I think I can
get a step closer to the gold standard. I can do all my analyses and just add them to a
Docker image and distribute it for everyone to use. Check out how to do that 
[here](http://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/06-Sharing-all-your-analysis.html).
And the great thing is, that everyone will have the same settings and versions of 
packages as I did when I did the analyses and thus get exactly the same results.

All in all I am really happy that I learned Docker and can only recommend researchers
who work with R to learn it, too.
