The coefficient of determination is otherwise known as \\(R^2\\) and is often used to 
determine whether a model is good.
The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) 
says that \\(R^2\\) "[...]  is a number that indicates how well data fit a statistical model –
sometimes simply a line or a curve. An \\(R^2\\) of 1 indicates that the regression line perfectly
fits the data, while an \\(R^2\\) of 0 indicates that the line does not fit the data at all".
From this we could conclude that we can use this measure to indicate how good our model
is. There are, however, 2 major problems with that conclusion:

1. Sometimes just having a model that is a little better than random guessing is already
great.
2. Adding useless covariates to the model improves \\(R^2\\).

The first argument is supported best by the example stock market. If I have a model
that is just a little bit better than random guessing, I will be rich.
The second argument I want to show on an example.


{% highlight r %}
set.seed(17)

n <- 200

x <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 1, sd = 1)
y <- 2 + 5 * x + rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 20)
df <- data.frame(y = y, x = x)

lmod <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
summary(lmod)
{% endhighlight %}

So we have an outcome \\(y\\) that depends on a covariate \\(x\\), but the noise is 
very high, so our \\(R^2\\) is pretty low. Let's add further useless covarates to the
model.



{% highlight r %}
R2 <- data.frame(p_useless = NULL, R2 = NULL, adjusted = NULL)

for(i in 1:(n-1)) {
  j <- ncol(df)
  df[ , j+1] <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  tmp <- data.frame(p_useless = i,
                    R2 = c(summary(lm(y ~ ., data = df))$r.squared)
  )
  R2 <- rbind(R2, tmp)
}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = R2, aes(x = p_useless, y = R2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ylab(expression(R^2)) + 
  xlab("number of useless covariates")
{% endhighlight %}

And voilà the more random covariates we add the better the model according to \\(R^2\\).
Does not make sense right?
